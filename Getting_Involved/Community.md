# Getting involved with an existing Community

There are over 300 communities worldwide that are collaboratively working on the realization of the open network. Find out what community is closest to your area [here](http://thethingsnetwork.org/community).

# Starting a new Community

If there's no community in your area yet, you can start initiate one yourself. 

With a small group of people it is possible to provide an entire city (or an area) with data connectivity for things to connect to the internet. In less than 6 weeks, the city-wide network in Amsterdam was crowdsourced and implemented, you can do the same in your area.

## Community Page

To set up your community page on thethingsnetwork.org, we need a few details that you can submit using [this form](http://thethingsnetwork.org/start-a-community/). Before you fill in the form, you should ask yourself a couple of questions:

* For what city or region are you setting up a community?
* What do you want to accomplish with the community?
* Do you have a couple of beautiful, high quality photos that represent your city or region (that you're allowed to use)?
* Do you already have some community members?
* How can potential community members contact you?

## Communication

Communication is the most important thing in a community. Existing communities use [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [forums](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/c/regions), [mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/). Probably the easiest way is to join the official [The Things Network Community Slack](http://slack.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create dedicated channels (chat rooms) for your community.

## Getting Together

The most amazing things happen when you come together with your community. Start a new [Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/) or [Part-up](https://part-up.com/tribes/thethingsnetwork), visit meetups of other communities and learn from each other.

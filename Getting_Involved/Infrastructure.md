# Building the Infrastructure for The Things Network

Gateways are the foundation of The Things Network. There are already many gateways active in The Things Network, and more are being deployed every day.

_A live version of this map is available on [thethingsnetwork.org/map](http://thethingsnetwork.org/map)_

To keep improving network coverage, we want to keep deploying more gateways across the world. You can help us doing this by:

* [[Buying Gateways|Hardware/Gateways/Home]] if you can place gateways in an area without coverage
* [[Sponsoring Gateways|Wishlist]] if you want to help a community fund the placement of gateways
* [[Sponsoring Locations|Wishlist]] if you have access to a high building. This significantly increases the range (and thus, value) of a gateway

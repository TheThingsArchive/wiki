## Activation

During the _Registraton_ of a _Device_ or _Gateway_ you set or get keys. Activation is the process of using the keys to connect/identify with The Things Network.

## Application


## Console
## EUI

## Gateway

The bridge between a _Node / Device_ and The Things Network. Talks to Nodes via _LoRa_ and connects to The Things Network via an internet connection, either via WiFi or Ethernet.

## LoRa

LoRa is a spread spectrum radio technology featuring long range and low power broadcast communication. LoRa specifies how bytes are transmitted into the air, but does not specify the meaning of those bytes.

## LoRaWAN

Is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification that specifies a network (MAC) protocol on top of LoRa. LoRaWAN gives actual meaning to the bytes transmitted over LoRa: addresses, port numbers, frame counters, data and security checks. LoRaWAN also specifies the encryption of messages.

## Node / Device

Connects to an _Application_ on the internet via a _Gateway_ that forwards messages to The Things Network.

## Registration

You register devices and gateways with The Things Network so that we can identify them during _Activation_ and when they transmit data.

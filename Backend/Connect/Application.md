## Streaming Data

Use any MQTT client to connect to the Handler.

You can find a Quick Start and API Reference for the MQTT broker in the [documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/mqtt/).

## Stored Data

The Things Network Handler does not store data. The **Storage Integration** can be activated to store data in a time-series database.

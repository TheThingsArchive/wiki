# Kerlink Firmware

- Installed from USB drive
  - USB 1.1 device
  - FAT32 filesystem
- **System Firmware** (usually) from Kerlink
  - Installed in `/` partition
- **User Firmware** from TTN/TTI/Partner
  - Installed in `/mnt/fsuser-1` partition
  - Includes "global" configuration

Update Process:

- Plug in the USB drive
- Wait for 5 minutes
- Log file is written back to USB drive (`produsb.log`)

## System Firmware (v3.1)

- The Gateway is shipped with Kerlink's "stock system firmware".
- A backup of this system firmware is kept for recovery purposes (on the rescue FS).
- The system firmware can be updated by putting the contents of `usbflashdrive_wirmav2_wirnet_v3.1.zip` on a USB drive.
  - Firmware updates do not overwrite the backup, rescue FS can be updated with `fs_rescue` files (see Kerlink wiki).
  - Contents of USB drive:
    - `u-boot.bin` - the bootloader binary
    - `initramfs.cpio.gz.uboot` - the initial RAM filesystem that handles updates and recovery
    - `script_uboot.img` - bootloader scripts
    - `produsb.sh` - this script is executed by the initramfs
    - `uImage` - the Linux kernel
    - `rootfs.tar.gz` - the root filesystem, will be extracted to `/` (`/dev/mtdblock5`)
    - `userfs.tar` - the user filesystem, will be extracted to `/mnt/fsuser-1` (`/dev/mtdblock6`)
- Recovery:
  - The gateway automatically restores the "stock system firmware" from the rescue FS if it detects that it's unstable.
    - Gateway is considered unstable if the u-boot `bootfail` variable is greater than `max_bootfail`.
    - `max_bootfail` is 20 by default. The `bootfail` variable is incremented on each boot and reset when the gateway successfully starts.
    - Both `bootfail` and `max_bootfail` can be set with the `fw_setenv` tool (or with `setenv` and `saveenv` in the u-boot console).
    - Forcing the recovery process is be done by pressing the reset button for at least `max_bootfail` times with intervals of 4-10 seconds.
  - This does not overwrite the user filesystem `/mnt/fsuser-1` (`/dev/mtdblock6`).

## User Firmware and System Firmware Customizations

- The Gateway is usually shipped without or with outdated user firmware.
- The user firmware can be updated with `dota_XXXX.tar.gz` and `custo_XXXX.tar.gz` files.
- Contents of USB drive:
  - `produsb.sh` - the script that executes the update steps
  - `dota_XXXX.tar.gz` customizes/updates the **user firmware**
    - Example contents of a `dota_thethingsnetwork_XXX.tar.gz` file:
      - `begin_dota.sh` - executed at the begin of the update
      - `end_dota.sh` - executed at the end of the update
      - `mnt/fsuser-1/thethingsnetwork/poly_pkt_fwd.sh` - script that wraps the packet forwarder (sometimes called `wrapper.sh`)
      - `mnt/fsuser-1/thethingsnetwork/poly_pkt_fwd` - the packet forwarder binary
      - `mnt/fsuser-1/thethingsnetwork/global_conf.json` - configuration file for the packet forwarder
      - `mnt/fsuser-1/thethingsnetwork/manifest.xml` - description of the "package" including auto-start settings
    - When editing the contents of this file, compress with `tar -cvzf dota_upgrade.tar.gz --owner root --group root mnt usr` (use `gtar` on macOS)
  - `custo_XXXX.tar.gz` customizes/updates the **system firmware** (**and** the backup)
      - Example contents of `custo_libloragw_4.1.3-klk3_wirnet.tar.gz`:
        - `usr/local/bin/util_fpga_start` - Utility to start the FPGA that handles listen-before-talk (LBT)
- Recovery:
  - Just flash again with correct `dota` file
  - Manually delete files/folders from `/mnt/fsuser-1`

## USB Firmware update security

- Set a password in `/etc/usbkey.txt` on the gateway
- The same password must be in `usbkey.txt` on the USB drive

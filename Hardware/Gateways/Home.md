# Gateways for The Things Network

Which gateway is right for you, depends a lot on your use-case and budget. Unfortunately, our [[The Things Gateway|Hardware/Gateways/The-Things-Gateway]] is not shipping until Summer 2016, so until then, you should use one of the alternatives. We know many people that are quite happy with their [[Kerlink|Hardware/Gateways/Kerlink]], [[Multi-Tech|Hardware/Gateways/Multi-Tech]] or [[Lorank|Hardware/Gateways/Lorank]] gateway. There are some other options, and you can even [[build your own|Hardware/Gateways/DIY]].

We also love the [comparison matrix](https://www.loriot.io/lora-gateways.html) our friends at Loriot built.

# Accessories

After you figure out which gateway you want, you probably also want to take a look at accessories such as [[antennas|Hardware/Gateways/Antennas]] and
[[lightning protection|Hardware/Gateways/Lightning-Protection]].

# Setting up a Gateway

1. Choose the right gateway for your purpose. There are gateways for both indoor and outdoor placement.
2. Find a [[good spot for your gateway|Hardware/Gateways/Placement]]. Higher is usually better. If you place your gateway outside, you probably should have a look at [[antennas|Hardware/Gateways/Antennas]] and
[[lightning protection|Hardware/Gateways/Lightning-Protection]].
3. Follow the setup guide for your specific gateway (see the links on the bottom of this page).
4. Configure the gateway for The Things Network. See [[Connect a Gateway|Backend/Connect/Gateway]]
5. Log in to [thethingsnetwork.org](http://thethingsnetwork.org/), and register your gateway from your user profile.

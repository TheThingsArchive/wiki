# Gateways for The Things Network

Which gateway is right for you, depends a lot on your use-case and budget. Unfortunately, our [[The Things Gateway|Hardware/Gateways/The-Things-Gateway]] is not shipping until Summer 2016, so until then, you should use one of the alternatives. We know many people that are quite happy with their [[Kerlink|Hardware/Gateways/Kerlink]], [[Multi-Tech|Hardware/Gateways/Multi-Tech]] or [[Lorank|Hardware/Gateways/Lorank]] gateway. There are some other options, and you can even [[build your own|Hardware/Gateways/DIY]].

We also love the [comparison matrix](https://www.loriot.io/lora-gateways.html) our friends at Loriot built.

# Accessories

After you figure out which gateway you want, you probably also want to take a look at accessories such as [[antennas|Hardware/Gateways/Antennas]] and
[[lightning protection|Hardware/Gateways/Lightning-Protection]].

# Setting up a Gateway

1. Choose the right gateway for your purpose. There are gateways for both indoor and outdoor placement.
2. Find a spot for your gateway. Higher is usually better. If you place your gateway outside, you probably should have a look at [[antennas|Hardware/Gateways/Antennas]] and
[[lightning protection|Hardware/Gateways/Lightning-Protection]].
3. Follow the setup guide for your specific gateway (see the links on the bottom of this page).
4. Configure the gateway for The Things Network. Instructions for this can be found in the setup guide from the previous step. You can also follow the more general [[packet forwarder setup guide|Hardware/Gateways/Packet-Forwarder-Setup]].
5. You can register your gateway in your dashboard on [thethingsnetwork.org](http://thethingsnetwork.org/).

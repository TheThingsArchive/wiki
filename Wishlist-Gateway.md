Dear TTN,

Hereby we want to our village covered by LoRa network, we believe our village has potential to become smart Village. We also have some developer included me which talented to create something wonderful for our beloved village. Even tough some areas in the city i saw there's a gateway but it was not active and when i ask to the owner that's only single gateway packet forwarder.

With coverage until 15 km, i think developer here can build product to resolve problem such as:
- Water management
- Irrigation system
- Smart Parking
- Smart Housing
- B2B for startup
- etc

So, i think if we can get one gateway we can create wonderful world make easy for us. Please your support.


Regards,

Fadli
